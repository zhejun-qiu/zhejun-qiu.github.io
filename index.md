Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I study political violence, civil conflict and forced migration. My research examines the complex and contingent relationship between political violence and forced displacement. In my dissertation, I investigate how institutions and past traumatic experiences shape governments’ and individuals’ responses to displaced populations and how these responses, in turn, influence broader patterns of violence and stability. I am also interested in leveraging causal inference, computational methods, and formal modeling to explore both the micro-level mechanisms and the macro-level dynamics underlying conflict. 

I hold a B.A. in International Relations (2019) and an M.A. in Political Science (2022) from Tsinghua University, China. I also received an M.A. in International Economics & International Political Economy from Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). At the University of Pittsburgh, I earned an M.A. in Political Science with specializations in International Relations and Political Methodology. I expect to graduate in 2027.
