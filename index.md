Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. My research focuses on the nexus between political violence and forced displacement. 

I hold a B.A. in International Relations (2019) and an M.A. in Political Science (2022) from Tsinghua University, China. I also received an M.A. in International Economics & International Political Economy from Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). At the University of Pittsburgh, I earned an M.A. in Political Science with specializations in International Relations and Political Methodology. I expect to graduate in 2027.
