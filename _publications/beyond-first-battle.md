abstract: "Many wars are fought over distinct phases, where some underlying capabilities in one portion may have little or no bearing on others. However, existing models of bargaining while fighting treat battles as identical. We relax that assumption and examine what happens when a source of uncertainty only affects later phases. Under such conditions, learning becomes more difficult. More specifically, we find weaker types do not separate equilibria in the current period if types have identical likelihoods of winning the upcoming battle, even if later battles do depend on type. Thus, we have a natural information-based explanation for prolonged fighting. A case study of the Shining Path in Peru illuminates the mechanism."
