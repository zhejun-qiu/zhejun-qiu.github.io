abstract: "While the protection and welfare of internally displaced populations (IDPs) fall within states’ humanitarian responsibilities, governments often fail to fulfill these obligations during civil wars. Restrictive policies on IDPs, such as camp closures, aid restrictions, and forced relocation, can serve as counterinsurgency strategies aimed at disrupting suspected rebel support networks. However, such tools are not always effective in countering insurgencies. Instead, governments face a tradeoff between weakening rebels in contested areas and preventing conflict spillover into previously stable regions. Closing camps and relocating IDPs from contested areas to government-controlled territory can destabilize insurgents but may also trigger resource competition, riots, and dissatisfaction among government supporters. Consequently, governments may still have an incentive to provide protection and aid to IDPs in areas with rebel presence to prevent the spillover of unrest. This paper develops a formal model to examine the conditions under which governments restrict or provide public services to IDPs in contested areas. The model captures strategic interactions between civilians in conflict zones, the government, and its supporters in the shadow of rebel activities. The equilibrium shows that public goods provision is a necessary complement to political violence in enabling the government to manipulate patterns of internal displacement during civil war. Also, the government has an incentive to increase both its use of violence and its assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) in contested territories when civilian loyalty is low and large IDP inflows destabilize government-controlled areas. Using the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) panel camp assessment surveys (Rounds 24–32) in Ethiopia during the Tigray War from 2020 to 2023, I provide empirical evidence that supports the model’s findings."
