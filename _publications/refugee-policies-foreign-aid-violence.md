abstract: "International donors frequently rely on foreign aid to support refugee-hosting countries, yet the security implications of such aid remain contested. While some studies argue that aid projects targeting refugees can be exploited by non-state armed groups to fuel violence, recent research highlights the potential of aid to foster peace by improving the well-being of both refugees and local communities. I argue that whether foreign aid exacerbates or dampens conflict depends on the nature of policies governing refugees rights. Host state policies that allow refugees to work and move freely create positive externalities for local community, which can alleviate tensions between locals and refugees, thereby reducing individual grievances that increase the risk of violence. In contrast, restrictive refugee policies limit these spillovers, increasing the risk of refugee militarization and conflict. Analyzing the impact of World Bank aid in 1753 refugee-hosting provinces across 107 countries in the Global South, I find that aid allocation in countries with inclusive refugee policies is associated with a significant decrease in conflict in refugee-hosting provinces. The results from the subnational analyses hold using multi-level models and instrumental variable analyses, which help alleviate inferential problems associated with observational data. The findings indicate that international donors should consider the domestic refugee policies of aid recipients to enhance the effect of aid for both improving the welfare of refugees and locals and dampening the risk of violence in refugee hosting communities."
