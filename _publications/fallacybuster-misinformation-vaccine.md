abstract: "Logical fallacies are often embedded in misinformation to mislead the public and manipulate opinion. How can we help individuals resist misinformation in the new era of social media? While existing research has emphasized fact-checking and media literacy training, we propose an alternative approach: enhancing individuals' cognitive reasoning skills. We developed FallacyBuster, a ``vaccine-like'' intervention embedded in short, AI-generated videos that train individuals to identify three common logical fallacies: false causality, hasty generalization, and personal attack.We conducted a preregistered survey experiment (N = 2,416) in China in August 2025, randomly assigning participants either to a treatment group—exposed to one of the FallacyBuster videos — or to a control group that received placebo training on recycling. The results show that participants who received FallacyBuster were less likely to endorse misinformation items in general. We also find evidence of motivated reasoning: individuals high in nationalism are more likely than their low-nationalism counterparts to endorse misinformation framed with nationalist narratives. Yet \textit{FallacyBuster} shows no evidence of backfire effects. FallacyBuster makes three contributions: it emphasizes cognitive skills over belief correction to avoid backfire, delivers scalable and low-cost inoculation through AI-generated short videos, and provides an apolitical strategy that extends inoculation research into authoritarian settings."
