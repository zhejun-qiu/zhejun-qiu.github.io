title: "Do Refugees Fuel Conflict, or Just Make It Visible?"

abstract: "While a large literature examines whether refugees fuel civil conflict, far less is known about their effects on smaller-scale social conflict, such as communal clashes, disputes, and protests, that often pose the most immediate threats to refugees and local communities. Yet, these dispersed, low-level conflicts are inherently difficult to detect and systematically record, especially in remote and marginalized areas where refugees tend to settle. This research note argues that refugee inflows can affect not only the actual risk of social conflict but also its observability, raising the risk of upwardly biased estimates of violence. Refugee camps and settlements often attract security forces, humanitarian organizations, and journalists, increasing the likelihood that incidents of social conflict are observed and reported. Combining global subnational analyses with micro-level data from Afghanistan and employing multiple empirical diagnostics to probe reporting bias, we show that areas hosting refugees appear to experience more social conflict, but much of this pattern coincides with increased media presence. While we cannot fully measure or adjust for this bias, our findings underscore how ignoring detection dynamics can distort conflict data and yield misleading inferences about the effects of refugee hosting on local violence."
